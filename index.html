      <p>Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!</p>
      <p>What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.</p>
